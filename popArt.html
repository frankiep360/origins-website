                        <p>American artist known for his bold, graphic style and socially conscious themes. Emerging from New York City's graffiti scene in the 1980s, Haring's iconic figures, vibrant colors, and dynamic lines became synonymous with Pop Art. His public art, including subway drawings and murals, tackled issues like AIDS awareness, apartheid, and inequality, blending activism with accessibility.</p>
                        <p>Haring's work bridged high art and street culture, making art inclusive and impactful. His legacy continues through the Keith Haring Foundation, which supports education and HIV/AIDS initiatives, solidifying his role as a transformative figure in contemporary art and social activism.</p>

                        <p>American artist and a leading figure in the Pop Art movement. Known for his iconic works like Campbell's Soup Cans and Marilyn Diptych, Warhol blurred the lines between high art and popular culture by incorporating commercial imagery and mass production techniques like screen printing.</p>
                        <p>Warhol's exploration of consumerism, celebrity culture, and media transformed art into a commentary on modern society. His studio, The Factory, became a hub for creativity and countercultural expression. Warhol's innovative approach redefined art's role in contemporary culture, making him one of the most influential artists of the 20th century.</p>
