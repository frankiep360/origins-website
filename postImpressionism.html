                        <p>Vincent van Gogh was a Dutch Post-Impressionist painter known for his emotional depth, bold colors, and expressive brushwork.

                        <p> </p>
                        <p>Van Gogh's innovative use of color and form expanded Post-Impressionism, influencing modern movements like Expressionism. His ability to convey raw emotion and spiritual intensity redefined artistic expression.

                        <p>Edvard Munch was a Norwegian painter and printmaker whose emotionally charged works explored themes of love, anxiety, and mortality.

                        <p>Munch's work bridged Post-Impressionism and Symbolism, emphasizing emotional expression over realistic representation. His innovative style influenced modern art movements, including Expressionism, inspiring artists to delve into psychological and emotional depths.
