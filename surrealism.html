                        <p>Spanish artist and a leading figure of the Surrealist movement. Known for his eccentric personality and vivid imagination, Dalí created iconic works like The Persistence of Memory, blending hyperrealistic detail with dreamlike, symbolic imagery. He employed innovative techniques, such as his "paranoiac-critical method," to explore the subconscious, drawing on themes of dreams, fear, and fantasy.</p>
                        <p>Dalí's impact on Surrealism extended beyond painting. He collaborated with filmmakers like Luis Buñuel and Alfred Hitchcock, bringing surrealist ideas into cinema. His flamboyant persona and creative versatility helped popularize Surrealism, making him a symbol of 20th-century art.</p>

                        <p>French Surrealist painter known for his dreamlike landscapes filled with abstract, biomorphic forms. Inspired by Giorgio de Chirico, Tanguy joined the Surrealist movement in the 1920s and developed a unique style characterized by meticulously detailed, otherworldly scenes. His works, such as Mama, Papa is Wounded!, evoke a sense of mystery and psychological depth.</p>
                        <p>Tanguy's contributions to Surrealism lie in his ability to visualize the subconscious through his distinctive imagery and techniques. His influence extended to later abstract and surrealist artists, solidifying his place as a key figure in the evolution of modern art.</p>
